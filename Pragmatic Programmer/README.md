# Chapter 1
- What is a Pragmatic programmer: A feel or style of the way they approach problems and solutions.
- Being aware of the bigger picture.
- Software Entropy: refers to the tendency for software, over time, to become difficult and costly to maintain.

## The Cat Ate My Source Code
- **Take responsibility** it is up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.
- "When you do accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it."
- Instead of excuses, provide options. Prepare the conversation in your head.

**Challenges**
How do you react when someone—such as a bank teller, an auto mechanic,or a clerk—comes to you with a lame excuse?
What do you think of them and their company as a result?

I would react in a way such that if there is any other alternative solutions, and if they don't know, I would think they
are not qualified for the job.

## Software Entropy
- Also know as "software rot"

## 3 Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs
- Soldiers come back and want some food from the villagers, the villagers don't have enough to share so they shut the soldiers out.
The soldiers start boiling 3 stones in the pot and the villagers got curious of this "stone soup". Soldiers tricked the villagers
into saying it would taste better with these ingredients. Out of the villagers curiosity they brought them all the ingredients.
- The soldiers act as a catalyst, bringing the village together so they can jointly produce something that they
couldn’t have done by themselves—a synergistic result.
- **Villager's side** always remember the big picture. Don't lose sight of how rations are low in this case. Like the frog in boiling water.

## Good-Enough Software
- Make Quality a Requirements Issue.

## Knowledge portfolio
- Keep up to date with techniques since they get outdated fast.
- Invest regurally, Diversify, Manage Risk
- Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear.

## Communicate
- Majority of our day is spent communicating, so be well at it.

# Chapter 2
- **Evils of duplication**: Don't have duplicate logic, **Orthogonility**: not to split any one piece of knowledge across
multiple system components.

## Evils of Duplication

- DRY: Don't repeat yourself.
- Duplication arises from:
  - **Imposed duplication**: Developers feel they have no choice—the environment seems to require duplication.
  - **Inadvertent duplication**: Developers don’t realize that they are duplicating information.
  - **Impatient duplication**: Developers get lazy and duplicate because it seems easier.
  - **Interdeveloper duplication**: Multiple people on a team (or on different teams) duplicate a piece of information.

## Orthogonility
- Two or more things are orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the others.

## Coding
- Keep your code decoupled.
- Avoid global data.
- Avoid similar functions.

## Reversibility
- There Are No Final Decisions

## Tracer Code
- Users get to see something working early.
- Developers build a structure to work in.
- You have an integration platform.
- You have something to demonstrate.
- You have a better feel for progress.

## Prototyping
- Things to prototype:
  - Architecture
  - New functionality in an existing system
  - Structure or contents of external data
  - Third-party tools or components
  - Performance issues
  - User interface design
- prototype to learn.

# Chapter 3

## Building tools
- Spend time learning to use these tools.
- The tools will have become extensions of your hands.

## Debugging
- Explain things to someone "rubber ducking" could give you new insights.

## Code Generators
- Passive code generators are run once to produce a result.
- Active code generators are used each time their results are required.

# Chapter 5

## Decoupling and the Law of Demeter
- If one module gets compromised and has to be replaced, the other modules should be able to carry on.
- Minimize Coupling Between Modules.

## Metaprogramming
- Configure, Don’t Integrate. Make program highly configurable.
- Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata

## Temporal Coupling
- Time is an often ignored aspect of software architectures.
- There are two aspects of time that are important to us: concurrency (things happening at the same time) and ordering
(the relative positions of things in time).

## Workflow
- Analyze Workflow to Improve Concurrency

## Architecture
- Design using services

# Chapter 6

## Refractoring
- **Duplication** You’ve discovered a violation of the DRY principle
- **Nonorthogonal design** You’ve discovered some code or design that could be made more orthogonal.
- **Outdated knowledge** Things change, requirements drift, and your knowledge of the problem increases. Code needs to keep up.
- **Performance** You need to move functionality from one area of the system to another to improve performance
